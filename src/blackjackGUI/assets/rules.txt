    Starting Stage:
        Each player is dealt the first two card of their hand.
        The house is dealt the first two cards of its hand.
        Players may already bust at this stage.

    Adding Cards Stage:
        Each player is allowed to draw more cards until they bust.
        Players may stop drawing cards at any time.
        The house will stop drawing cards once it has reached 16 or higher.
